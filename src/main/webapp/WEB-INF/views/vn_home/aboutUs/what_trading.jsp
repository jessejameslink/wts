            <h4 class="cont_subtitle">Mirae Asset Daewoo’s team of independent investment professionals trades assets linked with our financial product lineup and strives to generate steady returns through proprietary trading.</h4>
            <p>In order to satisfy the varying investment needs of both individual and institutional investors, we have developed a wide array of financial products such as repurchase agreements (RP) and derivative-linked products (ELS, DLS), which offer attractive opportunities to clients and, at the same time, provide hedging opportunities via the trading of underlying assets.</p>
            <p>Leveraging our expansive capital base, we engage in proprietary trading (short-term trading of stocks, bonds, foreign currencies, commodities, and derivatives) and alternative investments (real estate, etc.) to secure stable capital gains.</p>
            
            <h4 class="cont_subtitle">Product-Linked Trading</h4>
            <p>We have developed a variety of derivative-linked products (ELS, DLS) and exchange-traded notes (ETN) with various underlying assets (e.g., stocks, indices, foreign currencies, credit, and commodities), targeting clients seeking medium-risk, medium-return investments in the current ultra-low interest rate environment. These products offer attractive investment opportunities to our clients and also promote increased stability (via the trading of underlying assets).</p>
            <p>We also provide our clients with short-term fixed interest directly or via cash management accounts (CMA) by managing RP assets.</p>
            
            <h4 class="cont_subtitle">Principal Investment</h4>
            <p>Leveraging our expansive global network, we invest in promising properties and competitive companies at home and abroad from a medium- to long-term perspective. These activities, coupled with robust risk management, allow us to generate stable earnings and capital gains.</p>
            <p>In addition, Mirae Asset Daewoo's prop trading business pursues steady capital gains via advanced trading methods in the bond, currency, commodities, and derivatives markets.</p>
